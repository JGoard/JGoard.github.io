Hi all,

I've decided to make a blog of some-sorts (if blogs are even a thing anymore) for discussing subject matter pertaining to embedded software, hardware, or anything semi-adjacent.

There will most likely be things related to project logs, did-you-knows, and posts regarding proper development enviroment setups, or proper embedded software practices.

I'll be using ruby and jekyll for this system, and this will be the first time touching web-development in over 10 years, so lets hope it just doesn't stay as a basic html page.

This is all a bit of a shot off of the hip, but lets see where this all goes!


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

Just a basic forever loop...

{% highlight c %}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  while(1)
  {
    printf("Hello World!");
  }
  return 0;
} 
{% endhighlight %}
